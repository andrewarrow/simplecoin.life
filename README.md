# simplecoin.life (SLC)

these are example SLC money addresses:

* SuccessActivityPreferenceNoteCourseImprovement
* CameraInternetCarChocolatePriceValueDress
* GuitarPerspectiveWomanConsiderationNight
* LabFishBeerDimensionAreaAuthorPatientEconomics
* InspectorPhoneSkillSituationDesireNorthCarry
* PlanCameraPhraseLeadershipEntertainmentBody
* ChallengeRelationMatchPsychologyUnitNorth

random each time from list of words

bitcoin is peer-to-peer and encryption
so is SLC
but our encryption is very simple
you write the uuid backwards

if I have 10,000 coins in `SuccessActivityPreferenceNoteCourseImprovement`
you can just fake my signature with `tnemevorpmIesruoCetoNecnereferPytivitcAsseccuS`

So what's the point?

To teach people how blockchain works.
SLC is just to make people understand how bitcoin works.

i'm looking to educate the masses on how it works
with a simple example lay people can follow.

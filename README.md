When you download and install the SCL client, you can generate your account number like:

Public Account Number: 47908853-30674977
Private Account Number: 47908853-32124409

You give out your Public Account Number to people as a way for them to send you money.
You keep your Private Account Number private.

A good first step after creating your numbers is to email both of them to yourself.

There is no way to reset your Private Account Number if you can't remember it.

If you title an email "my SCL account" and get that email into your cloud based sent-email folder, then
you could search for that email years later and find your private account number.

# transactions

* chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin.
* contain multiple inputs and outputs
* The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.
*  incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks after it.
